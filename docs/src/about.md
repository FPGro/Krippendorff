# The package

The package was developed in conjunction with a bigger project, because there was no implementation of Krippendorff's alpha until now. (I didn't find one at least)

For those who are curious, the framework described in the following paper is currently being implemented
in Julia:

> T. Schmid, 
> Using Learning Algorithms to Create, Exploit and Maintain Knowledge Bases: Principles of Constructivist Machine Learning, 
> Proceedings of the AAAI 2020 Spring Symposium on Combining Machine Learning and Knowledge Engineering in Practice (AAAI-MAKE 2020). 
> Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA, March 23-25, 2020.

# Special Thanks

Goes to *Antonello Lobianco*, for his Julia tutorial repository and GitBook, the [section](https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/language-core/11-developing-julia-packages) on **Developing Julia Package** which helped me out a lot in creating this package and setting up documentation and CI. Thank you.
